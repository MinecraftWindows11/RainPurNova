# RainPurNova - Resources, Pre-Release, Next!

### What's that?

An simple HTML Website and some style files for MirahezeBackrooms.

In order to save resources, it doesn't stored in my GitHub Pages.

Soon, I'll move all the files from the 'MySpace' folder over.

### Can I fork that?

Of course! You can fork it to use for yourself. But keep an eye on following the "LICENSE".

But its better to wait until this project is more mature before forking it, because there just isnt enough content right now.

# RainPurNova - Run新的东西，劈里啪啦，NO~NO~NO~

（顶上什么猎奇标题）

### 这啥啊？

一个普通的开发性项目，用于存储简易的前端代码，以及一些 Miraheze Backrooms 中站会用的样式。

咕咕咕……
